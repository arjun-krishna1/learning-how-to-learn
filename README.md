# Learning How To Learn
My notes for the [UWaterloo Learning How To Learn Seminar](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/CTE/learning2learn.html)

# Obtaining Higher Learning
- Just because you are spending time studying, does not mean you are learning
- It is important to study the right things in the right way
- Ensure that you have the top of Bloom's Taxonomy covered for class topics
- For this you need to have the bottom

## Study Strategies For Higher Levels [1]
- Look at someone else's solution and try to create them
  - Evaluating
- Look at tricky problems and generate your own tricky problems
  - Creating
  - Make them difficult
- Ask good questions about topics
  - Creating
  - What would happen if you changed this? changed this number to 5?
  - Generate in-depth questions, deep
- Course maps
  - What connections do different topics have with each other?
  - What connections do topics have across different courses
- Discussion
  - Just talk about the topics
  - The best people you can prepare with is peers
  - Your fellow classmates have questions
  - They might have answers to your questions
  - You have to justify your own solution a lot more to fellow students
    - you have to explain it a lot more carefully and in depth
  - Your peers may have questions that reveal gaps in your language
  - They may expose you to different ideas
  - You have to think more critically because students could tell you something wrong
    - makes you evaluate a lot more
  - If you can't come up with your own proofs
    - start by analyzing the proofs others have made
  - Get into a group and have discussions
  - Everyone bring one or two questions
  - Create a mock test
  - Pass it around to each other
  - Evaluate solutions of each other
  - Mark them
  - Don't do problems from the textbook in order
    - you already know what topics you have to use to solve the problem
    - In the integration by parts chapter, practice problems will use integration by parts
    - in tests, the questions are out of order
    - you have to analyze the question to figure out what topic
  - Ask questions to peers, teach something they don't know

Circuits
What grade would you like to achieve 90% - 100%, I can do a 100%
a is the only correct answer
it is realistic, all of you are talented and intelligent
you might need to do some work

aim for the stars, and if you only reach the moon. that's still pretty good
good time management skills, lots of hard work, good learning skills

don't shortchange yourself
you can obtain the highest levels
you have the capabilities
it will take a lot of hard work
support from peers

I am going to do as much as I can
I am going to work as hard as I can to get as close to that as I can

To get 100%, really work towards the higher levels

critically analyze where you are at

if you are trying a practice problem

if you have to go the solutions, or have to get help

you are not at the higher level yet

where are you on the chart? what should you do next to get higher?

everytime you are studying, look at the type of question you are doing

where are they on the chart?

can I do that on my own?

if yes, Yay! what questions can I do that are higher up in the levels

You must achieve the lower levels of learning before you can obtain the higher levels
- attending all classes
- doing all practice problems
- explain topics to your friends

To do really well at the University level, your level of learning needs to be at a higher level


Always critically evaluate your level of learning
- metacognition
