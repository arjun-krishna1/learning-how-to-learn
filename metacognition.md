# Thinking About Your Thinking
- people are over-confident about their knowledge
- how did you study?
- on your own or in a group?
- were you each solving problems on your own or together?
- how many of these problems did you solve?
- none!
- how did you expect to solve the problems during the midterm if you couldn't do it before the midterm

# Dunning-Kruger Defect
- people are very bad at understanding how good or bad they are at something
- where their abilities lie
- extra help sessions
  - only the best students show up
  - the good ones
- students who are really strong, think that they are weak
  - so they study really hard, go to extra help sessions
  - so they get better
- the students who are weak think they don't need extra help
  - they need to learn how to think about their thinking
- how can you benchmark yourself?

# Metacognition
- Taking charge of your learning
- professors are a guide
  - they will show you what you need to learn
  - they will give tips and guide
- but the responsibility of learning is on you
- if you don't go to class, they can't teach you
- if you don't use the resources given
  - textbooks, office hours, assignments, help sessions
- they can't make you
## Knowledge of cognition
- knowing how you learn
- hwo do you learn the best in a given situation?
- staying up all night is not a good way of learning
## Regulation of cognition
- monitoring and evaluating your learning
- what is your progresss? how far have you gone?
- where is your knowledge on the Bloom's taxonomy?
  - are you just remembering theorems and example problems
  - or can you create new ideas, analyze topics critically, etc.

# Benefits of Metacognition
- learn more deeply
- if you always evaluate where your learning is at
  - I only have this memorized, I can't critically analyze yet
  - if you know which stage of learning you are at
  - you can figure out which tools to use to work on your weak stags of learning
- just because you study more, doesn't mean your grade will go up
  - all nighters?
  - not even diminishing returns, because their grade goes down
  - they are studying ineffectively
    - doing problems you already know the answers to
    - reading a question, thinking about it for 30s, looking at the solution
      - if you know how to solve it you don't need to look at the solution
    - multitasking while studying
    - letting your friends solve all your problems
    - they're not learning deeply enough. Just blindly memorizing
    - studying when tired
    - **just practicing the problems they are good at**
      - hours on derivatives, which they are good at
      - but just minutes on related rates which are much harder
    - practicing something you already know how to do feels better
      - I feel good about what I've done
      - That one thing I don't know probably won't show up on the test
        - it always will
- make learning more efficient
  - read ahead in the textbook
  - do practice problems
  - you don't have time not to do those tings
  - spend time on things you are bad at, this will make your studying  more efficient overall
# How to improve metacognition?
- ask yourself questions
  - not only about content, but also yourself
- a lot of self-reflection
- Embrace Failure
# three spects about university learning
- class, assignments, learning
## Classes
- what did I hear in class that conflicts with my previous understanding
- how did the ideas of today's class relate to that of previous classes
- what parts of today's class did i find the most confusing?
  - What can I do to help myself understand the topics better?
- was i paying attention
- how can I improbe my classes
- what content did teacher indicate is most important
- how can I learn this better after class
- thinking carefully about what was presented
-  which parts you understood
-  which parts you need to work on
-  how you are going to work on them
-  can you become an olympic swimmer just by watching people swim
-  can you become a professional musician just by wathcing
-  watching professors
# Exercise: what questions do I need to ask myself regarding assignments?
- before, as you are trying to solve the problems, or after you get them back
- what topics are going to be covered in this homework
- what of those topics do I not understand
- which question was the most difficult for me to solve
- could I solve these questions if they were on a test? no extra resouces, friends etc.
- which of the questions do I need to do more like
- was I paying 100% attention while doing these problems
- what steps did I take in this solution
- what level of learning is this? did I create something new? evaluate my ideas critically? analyze new evidenve
## exemplars
- how can I generalize this question? ideas, steps, etc
- was ther one you knew how to do but you couldn't do it? where was my understanding lacking
- what aspects of the question reveal what technique, method I should use
- what question do I never want to see? i.e. which questions are going to be on the midterm
- if I finished this assignment, do I know everything I need for thee xam?
  - if this appeared on the exam would I be able to solve it?
- what is this question trying to teach me?
- teachers are thinking,  students will do the problem so they will understand content better
- students are thinking, find the answer
- is there a better way to solve this problem
  - can I find a shorter nicer proof
# Exams
- Do I know all of the topics at the very bottom level of the pyramid?
  - remember, apply
- what topics do I not remember or know how to apply?
- do I know how to create and evaluate new solutions?
- what questions from assignments could my prof ask me that would make me cry?
## Before
- am I familiar enough with the content? do I still need to study?
  - will I be able to solve the problems on my own without any aids
- can I do the questions fast enough?
- how can I study the best for this test?
- have I studied enough?
- have I covered all of the content that will be on the test?
## After
- did I get the mark I was expecting?
- how can I improve for next time?
- where did I make my mistakes?
- how can I study better for the next steps?
- what type of mistakes did I make?
  -  careless mistakes because of a few random mistakes
  -  did I miss a certain type of problem (creating, desing, evaluating)
  -  did I just not remember enough?
-  what are my weak points?
  -  how can I avoid these mistakes in the future
# Self- Reflect
- answer those questions
- how well am I going to do on this test? Most people are wrong
- while doing an assignment: could I solve this problem on my own in the conditions of a test (solutions, friend, professor, ta)
## Test yourself
- everyone pick a couple of questions
- make a mock test
- write it
- mark it together
## Concept maps
- how do different topics link together?
- what formulae?
- if you can't link them, you are probably missing something
- now there's lines all over the place
- connect it to other courses
# Final tips
- Solve problems on your own
  - without aids, like on a test
  - get help while you are studying, to get an understanding of the concepts
  - but at some points you should be able to do this
  - before the test, not after
- look up what you don't know
  - you shouldn't be skim reading a textbook
  - reading it carefully, thinking about your understanding
  - if you don't understand something, you need to stop
  - do whatever it takes to understand that concept
  - if you keep going even if you don't understand something -> they will get more and more lost in the future
  - you don't have time not to do that
- learning math is like building a house
  - a strong foundation can build a skyscraper (midterm)
# Story
- needed to read a book to help professor with research
- didn't just keep going, fill in those gaps
- first page took two months
- next page took two weeks
- first 6 pages took 3 and a half months
- rest took a week
- helped professor, was co-author on a paper
# Deliberate practice
- practice the things you are not good at
- make sure you are practicing like you would on a test
  - aids, friends, etc.
  - doing problems from one section, then the next, etc.
- make sure you don't have a lot of information on how to solve that problem
  - i.e. in the integration by parts section the problems will probably take integration by parts
- monitor your learning
- where are you on bloom's taxonomy?
